# rooms-homepage

This is a solution to the [Room homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq).

### The challenge

The challenge was intended to help me practice using CSS grid.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
